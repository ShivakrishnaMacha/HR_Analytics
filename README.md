# **HR Analytics Dashboard**

## **Problem Statement**
A mid-sized organization with 1,480 employees wanted actionable insights from its HR data to analyze attrition trends and address employee turnover challenges. As a Data Analyst, I developed an HR Analytics Dashboard to visualize key HR metrics, enabling informed decision-making.

## **Steps Followed & Learning from This Project**

### **1. Data Understanding**
- Explored HR data files in CSV format to understand attrition, employee demographics, job roles, and satisfaction levels.
- Identified key variables influencing attrition such as gender, department, job role, education field, and salary hike percentage.

### **2. Data Connection & Cleaning**
- Imported HR data into Power BI for integration.
- Applied ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) techniques to:
  - Clean missing or inconsistent data.
  - Standardize categorical variables.
  - Remove duplicate entries.

### **3. Data Modeling**
- Created a star schema to optimize query performance and ensure a clean data structure.
- Added a Date table to track trends over time.
- Established relationships between tables such as employee demographics, job roles, and performance data.

### **4. Key Measures Creation**
- Designed a "Key Measures" table for essential calculations using DAX, including:
  - **Attrition Rate (%)**: `(Total Attrition / Total Employees) * 100`
  - **Gender-wise Attrition**
  - **Attrition by Job Role and Department**
  - **Attrition by Salary Hike %`

### **5. Dashboard Development**
- Utilized a variety of Power BI visualizations, including:
  - Bar charts to display attrition by department and job role.
  - Line graphs to analyze trends such as the relationship between salary hikes and attrition.
  - Pie charts for gender distribution.
  - Heatmaps for education field attrition.
- Integrated slicers to filter data dynamically by department, gender, and satisfaction levels.

### **6. Visualization Formatting**
- Standardized colors and formatting for a clean, professional look.
- Used labels, tooltips, and dynamic titles for better interpretability.
- Ensured KPIs were prominently displayed for quick insights:
  - Total Attrition
  - Attrition Rate
  - Male vs. Female Attrition
